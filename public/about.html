        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm a 34-year-old dad living in Surabaya. I run my own business, and when I'm not immersed in my entrepreneurial ventures, I love to spend my time learning new technologies and coding. I have a keen interest in digital innovation and how it can be applied to improve everyday life and business operations.</p>
        
        <p>Apart from my tech pursuits, I also enjoy doing magic tricks. It's a hobby that not only amazes others but also constantly challenges me to learn and perfect new illusions. It's a great way to engage my creative side and take a break from the more analytical aspects of my work and interests.</p>

        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you'd like to learn more about me or my business, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to discussing new technologies, sharing coding tips, or even performing a magic trick or two!</p>
